<h1>28 Day coding challenge</h1>
</header>
<main>
<p>
    In this challenge i will  be creating a web page every day. This challenge was inspired by Jennifer Dewalt (See her stuff <a href="https://jenniferdewalt.com/index.html">jenniferdwalt.com</a>).
</p>
<p>
    The reason i am doing this is to build a portfolio and a set of skills that will make me more hireable.<br>
    I am currently 20 years old and would love to work in the software and web development industry.
